## Running with Docker Compose

To build and run the application using Docker Compose, use the following commands in your terminal:

### Start the application
```
docker compose up --build
```
This command will build the Docker images (if needed) and start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Stop the application
```
docker-compose down
```
This command will stop and remove all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your machine before executing these commands.
